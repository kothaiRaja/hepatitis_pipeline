//This Nextflow config file defines how your workflow should behave when using Singularity containers. Let me explain it in simple terms:

//What is a Profile?
//A profile in Nextflow is a set of configurations that tell Nextflow how to run your workflow in a specific environment. In this case, the profile is called singularity, and it configures the workflow to use Singularity containers.

//Breaking Down the Config:
//1. singularity.enabled = true:
//This turns on Singularity. It tells Nextflow to use Singularity containers for running the processes in your workflow.
//2. singularity.autoMounts = true:
//This setting automatically makes important folders (like your home directory) available inside the Singularity container, so files from your computer can be accessed by the container without any extra setup.
//3. singularity.cacheDir = ~/singularity_containers/:
//This sets the location where Singularity containers are stored (cached) on your computer. Every time Nextflow downloads or uses a Singularity container, it will be saved in this folder.
//This prevents Nextflow from downloading the same container every time you run the workflow, speeding things up.
//4. docker.enabled = false, podman.enabled = false, shifter.enabled = false, charliecloud.enabled = false:
//These settings turn off other container systems like Docker, Podman, Shifter, and Charliecloud. This ensures that only Singularity is used for running your containers.
//Summary:
//This profile is telling Nextflow: Use Singularity, store the containers in ~/singularity_containers/, and make sure that my files are easily accessible inside the container.
//Other container systems (like Docker) are disabled, so only Singularity is used when running the workflow.
